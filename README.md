# Design something day everynew!1
Every designer should practice their skills, their potentials to be better. Instead of surfing the web all day for inspiration or tips &amp; trick to help you improve your skills, why don't you just sit back and start creating things? Practice makes perfect!

So, I've made this to help you cast one less step on the way you practice your skills. Everyday will be a new color and new theme for you to start improving your creativity!
